To start, the three separate tables that were provided in the Kaggle competition have been merged together into one table. Here's what the head of that table looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# NOTE: If the following fails with "Error in file...", make sure to set the working director to the 
# directory where this file is found using `setwd()`
source('utility.R')
master <- get.master()
head(master)
```

### Data exploration and visualization

```{r}
# trending over time
sales.by.week <- ddply(master, 'Date', summarize, Sales=sum(Weekly_Sales))
sales.by.week$Sales_Millions <- sales.by.week$Sales / 10e6
with(sales.by.week, plot(Date, Sales_Millions, type='l', 
                         main='Trending of total weekly sales over time', 
                         ylab='Sales (millions)', xlab='Week'))
```
